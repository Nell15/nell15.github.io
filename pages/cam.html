        <p>
            I developped an ePortfolio as part of my Soft and Human skills class, and as a matter of fact, it is the website you're currently on.

          <h2>Infographic : civic engagement project</h2>
          <p>
            This infographic is the result of a group project in a team of 8 people where we had to create an infographic
            describing our plans and ideas regarding our civic engagement. I personally want to make computer science and 
            surrounding subjects accessible to everyone, which is why I want to work on actions similar to our "Inform" section. 
            As a matter of fact, I was part of the staff during the Capitole du Libre in November 2023.
